# CCP's Mission

Students and faculty in the CCP training area conduct research to understand the functions and mechanisms of cognition, communication, and behavior in human and non-human animals.  A unique feature of our training area is our integrative approach that combines cognitive, evolutionary, ecological, and comparative frameworks to answer fundamental questions about cognition, communication, and behavior.  We work on perception, memory, attention, concepts, learning, creativity, language acquisition and processing, communication across species, and decision-making. We use a variety of methods â€“ observations, experiments in the field and the laboratory, neuroscience investigations, and computational modeling. We prepare students for careers in academia (research and teaching), as well as in health, education, business, and industrial settings.
