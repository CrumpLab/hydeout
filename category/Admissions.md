Why choose CCP?

CCP faculty have unusually broad cross-disciplinary interests. Many faculty are in at least one other training area – ranging from Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience to Basic and Applied Social Psychology to Human Development – in addition to CCP. That gives students the opportunity to put together their own, interdisciplinary programs of study. CLD faculty use diverse research methods in both basic and applied research, thus providing students with skills that will be useful in a range of settings. Students work closely with faculty and begin their career by diving into a research question. The PhD Program in Psychology is at the CUNY Graduate Center, itself an institution that promotes an interdisciplinary perspective in a world capital. The Graduate Center attracts a diverse group of students, allowing students to learn from each other.
