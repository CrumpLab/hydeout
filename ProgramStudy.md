There are two required core courses:
  PSYC 73800 Cognitive Psychology
  PSYC 71600 Animal Behavior 1

Beyond the core requirements, students take elective and independent research courses (typically 3 cr each) until they reach 60 credits. Elective courses are chosen through consultation between the student and the student's advisory committee.  Course selection must be approved by the student's advisory committee.

In addition, all students enroll in
  PSYC 70500 Statistics I (3 cr)
  PSYC 70600 Statistics II (3 cr)
  PSYC 79900 Ethics (3 cr)
  PSYC 77100 Teaching of Psychology (3 cr) for a total of 12 credits.

CCP is a mentor-based and research-focused training area, so students are expected to enroll in PSYC 80200 Independent Research each semester (unless they have completed their 60 credits). (See the table below that presents the four focus areas.)  Students are strongly encouraged to take at least one independent research course with a faculty member who is not their primary advisor.

Electives must include at least three content courses (i.e., not methods, research, or professional development courses). CCP offers content electives in three of the four major areas of focus described in the table below. Many electives are routinely offered as special topics seminars that connect foundational work with leading edge research topics. The table below outlines sample course topics across the major foci.
