Over the summer of 2017, the faculty in the Animal Behavior and Comparative Psychology (ABCP) and Cognition, Language, and Development (CLD) training areas voted to merge into the new Cognitive and Comparative Psychology training area.

Existing students in ABCP and CLD will have the option to switch into the new training area structure, or remain in their current training area. The new CCP requirements are nearly identical to both ABCP and CLD
requirements, and even more stream-lined.
